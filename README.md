## Education

**Master of Mechanical Engineering (Thesis)** @McGill University

*Montreal, Canada  9/2014 - 9/2016*

* [*Semismooth Newton solver for periodically-forced solutions to a unilateral contact formulation*](http://julianshi.github.io/public/publication/2016_games/presentation.pdf), 24th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 2016 
* [*Harmonic balance method for Duffing oscillators*](http://julianshi.github.io/public/research/duff_hbm/latex/article.pdf) [[Code repository](https://github.com/julianShi/public/tree/gh-pages/research/duff_hbm/code)] 2016
