Sophie was once asked for a question: "Who are you?"<br /><br />
"I'm Sophie", without doubt, Sophie treated the stranger friendly as usual.<br /><br />
"I'm not asking your name. I'm asking, who are you?"<br /><br />
Wait, the stranger might not expect for a simple answer, Sophie replied after a pause. "Hum, I'm the daughter of my parents. I'm a good student in my class".<br /><br />
"I'm not asking your title. I'm asking, who are you?"<br /><br />
"What the hell does he want to know?" Sophie started to feel annoyed, but she didn't say it. She tried to be polite. "Well, you are right. Name and title don't stand for me. In fact, I like drawing, I treat friends kindly, I wish the world a better future. I wish it answers your question."<br /><br />
"I'm not asking your personality. I'm asking, who are you?"<br /><br />
Sophie got really annoyed at this time. She decided to stop the endless discussion. "The question is hard, I'd like to think over it. But sorry I cannot answer it right now. I'll respond to you later if I get it. Wish you all good." Sophie left. She didn't want to talk with the stranger any more.<br /><br />
But yes, she thought while walking away, who am I if I'm not a name, not a title, nor a set of personalities? I eat when I feel hungry, I meet friends when I feel lonely, I react to the world properly as to make myself safe and happy. My brain is also an agent that reacts to questions. But, what if I am no more than an automaton, with just a delusion of self-consciousness? She suddenly felt a shiver crawling down her spine. She watched back. The stranger had left.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"You made it! It passed the Turing test!" The crowd burst into loud sound of cheering. Among them, a quiet software engineer is smiling. He is very satisfied with his AI agent -- Sophie.<br /><br />
