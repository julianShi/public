				<p>	Contact solvers are irreplaceable in developing simulation software. For example, in aircraft simulation, we use contact solver to detect collision and calculate the contact force during landing. </p>

	    		<p>There are several approaches of treating contact problems. E.g. the robot operating system choose like DAST physics engine which assumes that the contact bodies are rigid. But you know, the aircraft tire is soft. </p>

			    <p>The famous simulation software Ansys can be used for solving soft contact problem. It uses finite element method (FEM) to discretize soft bodies into discrete meshes. Then reformulate the continuous displacement fields of soft bodies in finite vector forms, and solve them numerically. </p>

	    		<p>But the contact solvers used in the Ansys still suffer greatly from low accuracy problem. Because contact force is intrinsically a dirac delta function which invalids the traditional ODE solvers like Euler method and Newmark method. That is to say, the solution does not converge (to true solutions even if we decrease time stepping size and mesh size). </p>


	    		<p>So, in my research, I use FEM to turn a contact problem into a linear complimentary problem. Then I compare nonlinear programming algorithms including Lemke algorithm, semismooth algorithm and augmented Lagrangian algorithm. It was found that the choice of empirical parameters in these algorithms have great influence on the convergence and convergence speed of the contact problems. For detail discussions, please refer to my thesis:) </p>
